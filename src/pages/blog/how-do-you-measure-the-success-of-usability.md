Before the KPIs are decided, a digital product needs to have a starting point which is usually a strategy or a plan that acts as a roadmap for achieving the goals. I'm speaking about increasing revenue, market presence, quality products and so on.

##Measuring tangible results

After the goals have been finalized, the next step is to recognize methods in which a well-performing digital product could help in attaining them. The various ways of achieving goals may include a generation of leads, a reduction in support queries, an increase of social media shares.

The last step would be to convert this into something tangible. Let's say we want to generate more leads that can be measured through the number of contact forms submitted. The reduction in support queries can be evaluated by the number of people calling the company.

Our concrete measures are the Key Performance Indicators that should describe how the website can achieve broader goals.

###Which KPI should track the Usability?
There are remarkable metrics we can look at measuring that I arrange in three significant areas.

####Measuring usability:
* **Task success rate:** percentage of users able to accomplishing important tasks on our website.
* **Time to complete a task:** time for users to achieve central activities on our website
* **Error rate:**. percentage of mistakes of users when attempting to perform a task.
* **The System Usability Scale:** survey for mapping users thoughts of usability.

####Measuring engagement:
* **Attention minute:** how long users are paying attention to our content.
* **First Impressions:** how users initially respond upon inspecting the website for the first time.
* **Interactions:** how often users like, comment on or share our content
* **Interaction depth:** how many times do users click when navigating through the site.

####Measuring conversion:
* **Conversion Rate:** it's the most common KPI. It's crucial to know how many visitors become buyers. By the word 'conversion,' I do not mean the user necessarily needs to buy something. The user may sign up for the website's newsletter, maybe download an e-book or contribute to a cause.

###Limits of Key Performance Indicators
These solutions are not perfect, and there are always going to be additional aspects. For example, people might be sending an email instead of completing the contact form.

This leads us to a statement that the metrics which we will finalize to check the usability of our website will always have some flaws. We can only try to make them as good as possible.

KPIs can also have drawbacks, and we have to be sure not to settle for the wrong of them. Incorrect and irrelevant parameters can lead to damaging results for the website. For example, too much irritating pop-ups for leads generation harm user satisfaction in the long-term because they hinder in user-friendly experience.

###Conclusion
Key Performance Indicators can be viewed as a guide to achieving the better performance of the website as they facilitate in keeping track of the website's performance. They provide a roadmap for working towards the website's success. KPIs are measurable factors which direct our focus towards the areas where we need to give more attention.
