Lean UX follows a build > test > iterate loop. The idea is to get a product in front of real people, learn from them, then improve it. The problem with lean UX is that users aren’t very forgiving and they aren’t big on second chances if we piss them off.

Design Sprints are part of a dual-track agile methodology. They follow an unpack > ideate > evaluate > test > refine pattern that results in a user-validated (but rough) draft in a short span of time. It’s a non-standard sprint, executed with the express purpose of defining a robust agile backlog for design and development.

Once a validated prototype passes muster the track switches over to delivery, which looks a lot like lean UX but without the confusion as to a successful endpoint.

It helps to understand how we got here.

Classic UX

UX, as a pure form, is basically done on the Waterfall Model (development). A team will learn everything it possibly can before moving directly into product delivery without a pause for iteration. Yes, it’s a lot of pressure. No, it isn’t without major problems.

When the product launches, it starts the research cycle over again while developers iron out bugs.

This model is at the root of point releases, which happen about every 18–36 months. It’s why we used to see huge launches for things like “Windows 7” instead of the quiet releases of feature packs that occur today (Windows 10 Creators Update!).

Modern development almost always works through one of the Agile Methodologies though, typically in a Scrum (product development) setting. Agile delivery focuses on rapid iteration and typically releases a revised set of “shipable increments” every 2–4 weeks. It’s why Chrome has hit version 66 in less than ten years and Google never bothers to celebrate a release.

“Design is never done” — Luke W (Google)

Lean UX

Classic UX was incompatible with agile development, and Lean UX was Jeff Gothelf’s game changing answer to the problem. Unfortunately, as stated earlier, Lean tends to put half-baked products in front of real audiences in the name of hitting an MVP (minimum viable product) target. Angry or frustrated users develop lowered Switching Costs over time, and competitors are happy to offer a solution with less emotional baggage based on years of watching the original company’s evolution.

That’s basically how we got from Friendster to MySpace to Facebook to Instagram. At some point, users jump ship for an emotionally clean product, and they don’t come back just because you’ve fixed the old one.

No seriously, log back into MySpace some time. It’s a really nice setup. It’s also DOA.

Dual Track Agile/UX

Dual Track is a newer approach to agile development, which seeks to eliminate the waste and rework arising from fuzzy/incomplete/unvalidated design goals. It’s based on he premise that real development is expensive and users don’t like paying for broken experiences. Dual Track unifies a Google Ventures inspired Design Sprint with a scrum/scrumban development cadence.

In a sense it’s a hybridization of classic UX, sped way up, then bolted to an agile delivery cycle.

Things start slow with months of generative user research, which is very waterfall. Dev and design efforts focus on the current backlog while UX research happens in the background. It’s a non-blocking scenario, and it’s really important.

Too many teams have built amazing solutions to a problem nobody actually had because they didn’t do proper research. That’s an expensive mistake. It’s why there are dozens of premium event planning apps for your phone but you planned your last happy hour over a group text.

Let that sink in.

Only when the insight is ready can we begin a Design Sprint. Without significant generative research to work from, a team should remain on the iterative delivery track.

No breakthrough research? No point in a design sprint. Don’t bother.

I like to convert the insight to a creative brief, which articulates a design strategy. I’ve written about it in depth here: UX is Process: Designing From a Creative Brief.

The brief is then “unpacked” to an ideation team made up of designers, stakeholders, and actual users. The ideation team generates rapid-fire ideas that attempt to solve a stated design problem from every conceivable angle. Accuracy and fidelity don’t matter as much as getting way outside of the box. Conventional thinking doesn’t lead to breakthroughs.

The blue sky ideas are then run through the lenses of human-centered design and the unworkable ones are killed.

This is the lens set that I like to use:


IDEO’s lenses represent a more classic approach:


The ideas that’s survive the lenses are then ranked (I’m a fan of red route analysis) and the design team goes to work on a solution that incorporates them. The resulting concepts are bounced off of users and further refined. At some point the ideation team ends up with a concept that has a pretty high likelihood of pleasing the end user while making the business money, which we know because it’s been repeatedly tested along the way.

We call that prototype the MDP (minimum desirable product). The MDP looks a lot like an MVP (from lean) but represents a very different approach. It’s also known as a minimum lovable product, and it represents something you’d actually want to advertise.

But wait… the process is still evolving!

One of the strongest trends we’re seeing in 2018 is content-driven design on the digital side, which ensures the design sprint prototypes are based on a true expression of the value proposition instead of placeholder text. The MDP coming out of a design sprint contains real value, and expresses it to the users when it goes into testing.

We’re also seeing shorter user journey models that require less work for the end user, as a result of advanced Funnel Analytics and predictive data science.

On the delivery side of agile, design teams are embracing work in progress limits instead of scrum style time boxes (aka scrumban), which is really refreshing. Sprint.ly is an example of a Scrumban planning tool.

In Summary

The design sprint was a very clever innovation when Google Ventures came up with it, since it solved the waste & rework problem endemic to Lean UX. The model is continuoisly evolving though. GV style design sprints aren’t very friendly to enterprise design teams, nor to geographically distributed stakeholders with busy schedules. The process you’ll find at large companies is already well beyond the form you’ve read about in Sprint as penned by Jake Knapp, because it has to be.

Up Next?

Real time personalization doesn’t fit well with our current journey models, which design sprints are based on… standby.
