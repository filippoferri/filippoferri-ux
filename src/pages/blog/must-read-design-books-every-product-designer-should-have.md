UX design is a discipline that evolves all the time. That's why it’s important to keep up with advanced thinking, and new approaches to working. The following is a personal list from my book shelf.

###1. Don’t Make Me Think
![Don’t Make Me Think](/img/dont-make-me-think-filippoferri.jpg)
**Don’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug** (<a href="https://amzn.to/2HTWogM" target="_blank">Amazon</a>)<br/>
Steve Krug teaches UX designers how to achieve great user experiences in a straightforward and accessible way. The first release is dated 2000, but it's considered one of the defining texts in the industry and a valuable guide to UX experts around the world.

###2. Lean UX

Lean UX is an useful technique when working on projects in Agile organisation. It shows how we can take the Lean theory and apply it to our UX practice. It offers an excellent guide to designing products that are validated by real people and contains techniques about adding value and removing waste.

###3. Sprint

This book offers a reliable method for solving problems quickly. Facilitating a room of people is broken down into easy to follow steps. It’s a compelling process, and not just for UX designers.

###4. 100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People

**100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People by Susan Weinschenk** (<a href="https://amzn.to/2YmcVQ9" target="_blank">Amazon</a>)<br/>
This book, based on research about how people think, learn and decide, it's a handy reference for any user experience or visual designer. It is well organized, full of visuals and stories, and combines research from social psychology, neuroscience, and business.

*101 UX Principles by Will Grant*
Will Grant covers a lot of important concepts about UX, all supported by specific examples, technical considerations, common design mistakes, and personal opinions. Most of the tips we can directly apply to our daily UX job.

###6. Thinking, Fast and Slow
![Thinking, Fast and Slow](/img/thinking-fast-filippoferri.jpg)
**Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman** (<a href="https://amzn.to/2Ym4Qex" target="_blank">Amazon</a>)<br/>
Kahneman explains the human mind in terms of two systems: system 1 and system 2. "Although System 2 believes itself to be where the action is, the automatic System 1 is the hero of this book". The author explores cognitive biases associated with each type of thinking highlighting the human behavior.

###7. About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design
![About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design](/img/about-face-filippoferri.jpg)
**About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design by Alan Cooper, Robert Reimann, David Cronin, Christopher Noessel** (<a href="https://amzn.to/2YrvF0D" target="_blank">Amazon</a>)<br/>
This book provides effective techniques we can apply to our UI design. It's a collection of discussions on mobile apps, touch interfaces, screen size concerns, and more. It leads to product design methods, interface recommendations, and up-to-date examples.

###8. Interviewing Users
![Interviewing Users: How to Uncover Compelling Insights](/img/interviewing-users-filippoferri.jpg)
**Interviewing Users: How to Uncover Compelling Insights by Steve Portigal** (<a href="https://amzn.to/2urC7ah" target="_blank">Amazon</a>)<br/>
An excellent book for anyone who wants to read more about user interviews. Steve Portigal covers why to prepare interviews, how to conduct them physically, how to manage stakeholders, and how to present your findings. It's considered a go-to resource for market and UX researchers who want to improve their interviewing skills. If you need to understand your customers better, I suggest reading this book.

###Keep on reading
This is my selection for now. Clearly, I'm always on the look out for the best books about product out there.
