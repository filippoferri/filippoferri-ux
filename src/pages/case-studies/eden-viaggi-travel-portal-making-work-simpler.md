title: 'Eden Viaggi Travel Portal: making work simpler'
overview: Eden Viaggi Travel Portal is one of the most used tools for travel agencies in Italy. The big design challenge was to improve usability and visual appeal. I adopted a design-sprint approach to get some initial direction in the project, and the progressed through to full in-house implementation, using an evaluation-heavy human-centered design approach to reduce risk and uncertainty. I worked on user research, evaluation and UI patterns during all the iterations of the product’s evolution.

###Exploration

####Assumptions
It’s a good rule to start a project with a brainstorming session to recognize what the company is trying to achieve.

* Users have difficulties to read essential communications.
* Users don’t navigate many sections inside the old portal.
* Users ask help often to customer service.

####Key findings
The team conducted 20+ interviews to understand how the users are using the old portal and to discover what features they would prefer to have in the new one.

* Too many clicks to book a reservation.
* Users are overwhelmed with too much information.
* Users don't use at all some functionality.

####Quantitative Analysis
To better understand the main problems of the old portal, I’ve requested our Analytics teams to provide me with most recent data.

Main complaints:

* 80% of users focus on a single functionality.
* Some resources are not working or very hard to find
* Some section is visited by 2% of users

####Mind Mapping
I decided to go through a mind mapping method.

After this activity, I was able to prioritize the features for the new portal.

###Design Process
With the user pain points revealed, I moved on to the design process. I gathered together and sketched out a few variations of the portal.

####Prototyping
When I solidified a few ideas, I created a few prototypes.

Testing outcomes:

* Users liked the overview of the new interface.
* Users appreciated the new booking flow.
* Users loved new functionalities

####Perfect Pixel

###Conclusion
It was a successful design challenge, and the company saw significant improvements in portal performance. Iterative user research and prototyping led to a final product that increased usability value from 32% to 85%. The portal is used by 20,000+ agents in Italy on daily basis and receives 2+ million visits per month. Currently, I'm working on improving interaction elements based on continued review feedback and analytics tracking.
